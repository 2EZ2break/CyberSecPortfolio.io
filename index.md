# About Me  

Welcome to my cyber security portfolio website! I am Trent Cubine, a driven professional with a strong foundation in both web development and cyber security. With a background in web technologies, network security, and threat analysis, I specialize in building secure systems and conducting detailed security analyses.

I have hands-on experience in developing and maintaining secure web environments, most recently as a Digital Producer at Belk, where I worked on e-commerce platforms and digital marketing initiatives. Additionally, my role as a Jr. Web Developer at Mission Wired involved building secure donation websites for clients, optimizing performance, and executing impactful email campaigns.

I am continuously expanding my skills in cyber security through my academic background, including a BA in Mass Communication with a minor in Computer Science, as well as certifications like Google’s Cyber Security Specialization and CompTIA Security+ (currently in progress).

In my portfolio, you'll find several projects that showcase my skills in security, such as deploying my own SIEM system using Microsoft Azure and developing a Python-based Wi-Fi sniffer tool for network security analysis.

Explore my work and feel free to reach out to discuss how my expertise can help enhance your organization’s security posture.

# Projects

### Creating a SIEM in Microsoft Azure leveraging Microsoft Sentinel 

In this project I created a SIEM system in Microsoft Azure by leveraging Microsoft Sentinel. I launched a VM and created a log analytics workspace where I enabled Microsoft Sentinel. I then connected the VM as a data source and created analytic rules to flag specific instances from the VMs logs. 

[You can see my documentation of this project here](Building my own SIEM v3.pdf)

### CISCO Packet Tracer Projects  

I keep a repository of Cisco Packet Tracer Projects I've compleated. Each Project resides in it's own folder with its PKT file and a PDF with the project's goals and background work. In my Cisco Packet Tracer project repository, I showcase a variety of networking designs that demonstrate my proficiency in configuring and troubleshooting networks. These projects cover key concepts such as VLANs, routing protocols, network security, and IP addressing, with real-world applications like designing campus networks and implementing VPNs. Through hands-on experience, I've gained a deep understanding of network design, security, and management, which I’m eager to apply in professional settings.

### Various Python Projects

I maintain a repository of Python scripts focused on cybersecurity and penetration testing. One notable script, wifiSniffer.py, scans Wi-Fi networks within range of a Windows device, extracting key details like signal strength, encryption protocols, and authentication methods. Other scripts like SimplePasswordBruteForce.py demonstrate basic brute-force attack algorithms, while PortScanner.py scans IP address ports to identify open and closed ones. For more information on additional scripts, check the ReadMe.txt file in the repository.

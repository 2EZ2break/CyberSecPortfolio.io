### Creating a SIEM in Microsoft Azure leveraging Microsoft Sentinel 

In this project I created a SIEM system in Microsoft Azure by leveraging Microsoft Sentinel. I launched a VM and created a log analytics workspace where I enabled Microsoft Sentinel. I then connected the VM as a data source and created analytic rules to flag specific instances from the VMs logs. 

[You can see my documentation of this project here](Building my own SIEM v3.pdf)

### Various Python Projects

I maintain a repository of Python scripts focused on Cybersecurity and penetration testing. One of the scripts in this repository scans for Wi-Fi networks within range of a Windows device, extracting detailed information such as signal strength, encryption protocols, and authentication methods. SimplePasswordBruteForce.py demonstrates a basic brute-force attack algorithm designed to break a password by systematically guessing all possible combinations of characters. It serves as an example of how brute force attacks function in cybersecurity. PortScanner.py is a simple script that scans a IP address's ports to see which are opened and closed. The ReadMe.txt file in the repository will give you more information about files that I have not mentioned here.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
